The Tic Tac Toe Game is a web-based implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe, created during the early stages of my full-stack bootcamp journey. This project represents my exploration of web development, particularly my journey in learning and applying object-oriented JavaScript.

## Features
1. Interactive Gaming:
   - Immerse yourself in a captivating gaming experience powered by object-oriented JavaScript. Take turns and strategically place your marks (X or O) on the grid by clicking on the cells.
2. Player Personalization:
   - Customize your gamer tag and engage in friendly battles with friends or family.
3. Responsive Design:
   - Enjoy seamless gameplay across different devices, from desktop to mobile, thanks to a responsive grid.
4. Win and Tie Detection:
   - Challenge your skills. The game automatically detects wins when players form complete rows, columns, or diagonals with their marks. A tie is called when the grid fills up, indicating a draw.
5. Rematch Functionality:
   - Keep the excitement going. After each game, easily start a rematch without needing to refresh the page.

## Technologies
1. HTML:
   - The structure of the game is built using HTML, providing a solid foundation for the user interface.
2. CSS:
   - CSS is used extensively for styling the game, ensuring an attractive and responsive design.
3. JavaScript:
   - Object-oriented JavaScript powers the game, handling everything from game logic to user interactions and real-time updates to the gameboard.
     
4. Version Control with Git:
   - Git and GitHub are used for version control and project management, demonstrating your collaboration skills and best practices in code versioning.
